# 1. Create a new PyCharm file in the same project called operations.py. 2. Typethefollowingcode:
# var = input("Please enter a value: ")
# This is an easy way of outputting a prompt to the console and getting a reply. The variable var is a reference to that reply, which is a string.
# 3. Now print the following:
# a) The value of var as upper case.
# b) The number of characters in var (this does not require a method).
# c) Doesitcontainnumericcharacters?(trytheisdecimal()method).
#

var = input("Please enter a value: ")

print(var.upper())
print(len(var))
print(var.isdecimal())
